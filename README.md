## ðŸ‘‹ Hi team!

Welcome to the **main repository** for our LMS application built for Vitara Learning.

### ðŸ“Œ Purpose of this Repository

1. At the **start of each sprint**, every team member must sync their local setup with the **approved code from the previous sprint**.
2. For example, at the beginning of **Sprint 2**, everyone should pull from this repo, which will contain the **Sprint 1 code reviewed and approved by our lead, Madhav**.
3. This repository also helps in **version tracking** and keeping the application development **synchronized and organized**.

Thanks, and happy coding! ðŸš€
